  <h2>Installing Docker and Docker Compose</h2>
  <p>We‚Äôll now install Docker and Docker Compose so we can run the helpdesk system in containers.</p>

  <h3>Step 1: Update your system</h3>
  <pre><code>sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y</code></pre>

  <h3>Step 2: Install Docker & Docker compose</h3>

 <pre><code>sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose -y </code></pre>
  
  <h3>Step 4: Verify Installation</h3>
  <pre><code>docker --version
docker-compose --version</code></pre>

  <p>If you see version numbers, Docker and Compose are ready to use.</p>

  <h2>Setting Up the Project Folder</h2>
  <p>Let‚Äôs now create a working directory for the Peppermint Help Desk and add the Docker configuration file.</p>

  <h3>Step 1: Create the Project Folder</h3>
  <pre><code>mkdir peppermint
cd peppermint</code></pre>

  <h3>Step 2: Create the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> File</h3>
  <p>Inside the <code>peppermint</code> folder, create a file named <code>docker-compose.yml</code>:</p>
  <p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/OHYctl3.png"  height="80%" width="80%" alt="peppermint logo"/>
</p>
  <pre><code>nano docker-compose.yml</code></pre>

  <h3>Step 3: Paste the Configuration</h3>
  <p>Copy the contents of the file from the official GitHub repository:</p>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/Peppermint-Lab/peppermint/blob/main/docker-compose.yml">https://github.com/Peppermint-Lab/peppermint/blob/main/docker-compose.yml</a></p>

  <p>Paste the contents into the file, then save and exit (in nano: <code>Ctrl+O</code>, <code>Enter</code>, then <code>Ctrl+X</code>).</p>

  <h2>Start the Peppermint Help Desk</h2>
  <p>With the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file in place, you can now start the helpdesk application using Docker Compose.</p>

  <h3>Run the following command to start the containers:</h3>
  <pre><code>sudo docker-compose up -d</code></pre>

  <p>This command tells Docker Compose to start all the services defined in the file in the background (detached mode).</p>
  <p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/HLOISgc.png"  height="80%" width="80%" alt="peppermint logo"/>
</p>

  <h3>Verify That It's Running</h3>
  <p>To check the status of the containers and find out which port the helpdesk is running on, use:</p>
  <pre><code>sudo docker ps</code></pre>

  <p>This will display a list of running containers. Look under the <strong>PORTS</strong> column to find the port number mapped to the helpdesk web interface (typically something like <code>0.0.0.0:3000-&gt;3000/tcp</code>).</p>

  <h2>Accessing the Peppermint Help Desk</h2>
  <p>Once the containers are running, you can access the Peppermint Help Desk interface from any web browser on your local network.</p>

  <h3>Step 1: Find Your Computer‚Äôs Local IP Address</h3>
  <p>Run the following command to find your local IP address:</p>
  <pre><code>hostname -I</code></pre>
  <p>You'll see something like <code>192.168.1.42</code> ‚Äî that's the address you‚Äôll use to access the helpdesk.</p>

  <h3>Step 2: Open the Help Desk in a Browser</h3>
  <p>Open your browser and visit the address below, replacing the IP and port if different:</p>
  <pre><code>http://192.168.1.42:3000</code></pre>

  <p>If everything is working correctly, you should see the Peppermint Help Desk login or setup screen.</p>

  <h3>Troubleshooting Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Make sure your firewall is not blocking the port</li>
    <li>Ensure Docker is still running: <code>sudo docker ps</code></li>
    <li>Check logs with <code>sudo docker-compose logs</code> if the page doesn't load</li>
  </ul>
